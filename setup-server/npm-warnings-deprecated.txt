Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.



The output you provided contains warnings from npm about deprecated packages in your project's dependencies. These warnings indicate that the packages you are using are either no longer supported, have security vulnerabilities, or have recommended replacements.

Here's a breakdown of the warnings and some suggestions:

1. **Deprecated packages:**
   - `inflight@1.0.6`
   - `npmlog@5.0.1`
   - `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties@7.18.6`
   - `har-validator@5.1.5`
   - `rimraf@3.0.2`
   - `@hapi/formula@2.0.0`
   - `glob@7.2.3`
   - `abab@1.0.4`
   - `are-we-there-yet@2.0.0`
   - `@hapi/address@4.1.0`
   - `querystring@0.2.0`
   - `gauge@3.0.2`
   - `uuid@3.4.0`

   - `sendgrid@1.9.2`
   - `@hapi/joi@17.1.1`
   - `core-js@2.6.12`

2. **Recommendations:**
   - The warnings often suggest replacements for the deprecated packages. For example, you can replace `inflight` with `lru-cache`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties` with `@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties`, and `@hapi/formula` with `@sideway/formula`.
   - Consider upgrading to the latest versions of the packages whenever possible. Newer versions often have bug fixes, security improvements, and performance enhancements.
   - If a replacement is not suggested, search online for alternatives or reach out to the package maintainers to understand the deprecation reason and recommended course of action.

Upgrading deprecated packages is generally a good practice to improve the security and stability of your project. It's recommended to carefully review the warnings and take appropriate actions to address them.
